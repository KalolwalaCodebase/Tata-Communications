            As a Company in ICT, we are heavily reliant on our energy supplies to run our operations 24X7. To meet this energy demand, we utilise various sources across geographies. These sources can be categorised into energy from diesel generators for backup, energy from national grids and renewable energy from public as well as private suppliers. Â With the operational energy demand and our upstream and downstream operations, the associated GHG emissions are inherent part of our value chain.

            Our comprehensive decarbonisation strategy seeks to reduce the GHG emissions across our value chain. Recognising the detrimental effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, we are committed to adopting operational enhancements that lower our GHG intensity. We have laid the foundation for targeted efforts to reduce our carbon footprint by meticulously tracking our GHG emissions, which include both Scope 1 and Scope 2 and 3 emissions, in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. The analysis and mitigation of Scope 3 emissions, involving emissions from employee commuting, business travel and other indirect activities, are also integral components of our strategy.

            with the 1.5-degree emissions trajectory. The targets have also been

              Energy efficiency is one of the key levers in our strategy which
              reduces our energy demand while accommodating the growing business
              needs.
            </h3>
            <br />
            <p>
            We invest significantly in our energy efficiency projects to improve the operations of the offices, networking centres and PoP locations while addressing the gaps in the infrastructure. To accomplish this, we undertake proactive actions by comprehensive planning and assessing the impacts of the initiatives at financial, technological, social and environmental level. These opportunities encompass all our equipments and facilities such as HVAC, SMP, UPS systems and illumination systems. With this holistic approach, we enable our operations to optimise energy usage and achieve our overall climate goals.<br />
              <br />
            </p>
            <p>
            We recognise monitoring and measurement activity as a critical element for us to maintain the efficiency of our infrastructure. Therefore, we ensure all our energy consumption across operations is monitored, measured and reviewed at all levels. This helps in identifying performance issues, taking corrective actions and benchmarking our systems with the global leading best practices. Furthermore, we conduct thorough internal energy audits to assess the current gaps and implement the opportunities.

                We have adopted a strategic approach to reduce emissions throughout our value chain as part of our comprehensive Scope 3 emissions assessment. Recognising that a significant portion of our carbon footprint is linked to our suppliers, we have identified our top suppliers as key contributors.

                <p>
                In response to this, we have devised our Climate Action in Supply Chain strategy under Sustainable Supply Chain Framework to enhance our engagement and collaboration with suppliers. With this strategy, each of the contributors have been assessed on their current climate performance and categorised on three levels based on their climate action maturity (GHG inventory, CDP disclosure and SBTi targets). For each maturity level, a set of engagement plan is implemented for the key contributors.

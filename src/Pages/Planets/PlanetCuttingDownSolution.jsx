        Cutting Down on Value Chain based Emissions
      </b>

      <p className="description-main-section-climate-change">
        We have taken a strategic approach to reducing emissions within our
        value chain as part of our <b>comprehensive Scope 3 emissions accounting.</b> 
        Recognising that a significant part of our carbon footprint is
        attributable to our suppliers, we have pinpointed our top
        suppliers—those who account for a substantial <b className="greensih-environment-section">
              60%of our procurement
        budget</b>—as principal contributors. <br /><br /> In response to this, we have
        established a <b>Sustainable Supply Chain Framework</b>  to deepen our
        engagement and collaboration with suppliers. This framework is pivotal
        in educating suppliers about climate change and empowering them with
        strategies to minimise their emissions. Our concerted efforts are
        supported by our active encouragement of suppliers to participate in the
        <b>annual CDP questionnaire, fostering transparency</b>
         and collective action
        towards our <b>net-zero ambition.</b>

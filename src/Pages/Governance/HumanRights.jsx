                    <h2>To strengthen the connection between our Business & Human Rights (BHR) initiatives and existing company policies, we have introduced a comprehensive Business and Human Rights Policy this year. <br /> <br /></h2>
                    <p>
                        This policy demonstrates our pledge to uphold the highest ethical standards in our business operations. It is in harmony with various national and international human rights frameworks, including the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the Modern Slavery Act 2015, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030, as well as Tata's own Code of Conduct and Affirmative Action Policy. <br /><br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The policy applies to all stakeholders identified by the company, including employees, contractors, communities, customers, and partners in the value chain. It covers key aspects of business and human rights, such as anti-bribery, anti-corruption, responsible usage, equal opportunities, fair competition, community engagement, respect for individual dignity, fair compensation, the right to privacy, information and asset integrity, freedom of expression, health and safety, product and service standards, and protections against trafficking, modern slavery, child labor, and breaches of data privacy and security.

The PoSH Charter is designed to address the prevention, prohibition and redressal of sexual harassment incidents targeting women in the workplace in India. <br /><br />

                        <b>Global Dignity in the Workplace Policy -</b> This policy enables us to eliminate all forms of workplace discrimination, harassment, bullying and retaliation. It allows us to foster a culture of respect, diversity and inclusion. Above all, this policy helps to provide equal employment opportunities and the creation of a safe, healthy and fair working environment.

                        Both employees and contract workers can report cases of human rights violation, including discrimination and harassment, through the DWP, POSH and Whistle-blower mechanism. The HR and Risk Management teams handle reported cases and present them to senior leadership and the board for review.

                        <b> <br />Grievance redressal mechanism -</b> We maintain a zero-tolerance stance towards any misconduct or infringement of Human Rights. We have implemented a thorough Whistle-blower Policy to address and rectify any grievances or improper conduct. This policy encompasses a broad spectrum of concerns, including human rights violations and health and safety issues, and offers various reporting avenues, such as an independent "Ethics Helpline." It ensures that individuals can report issues without fear of retribution. Additionally, the policy allows for confidential and anonymous reporting through a multilingual hotline. Grievances concerning sustainability or human rights can also be submitted through the contact section on our website.

                    We conducted an extensive human rights salience assessment to identify potential issues within our value chain and stakeholder interactions.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Prompted by our growing operations and the intricate nature of our value chain, this initiative responds to the heightened focus on human rights by investors and customers, as well as evolving business and human rights legislation. Our assessment reviewed our policies and performance, aligned them with global standards, and pinpointed key stakeholder human rights concerns. Utilizing the UNGP criteria and the RDR Corporate Accountability Index, along with Tata Groupâ€™s standards, we engaged stakeholders in a collaborative process to create a human rights risk matrix. This matrix evaluates risks across various business and human rights areas, guiding us to address gaps and improve our transparency continually.

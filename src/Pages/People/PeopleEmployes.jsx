                Each business unit bears the responsibility of identifying
                hazardous activity and conducting thorough Hazard Identification
                and Risk Assessment (HIRA). This assessment involves breaking
                down each activity into individual steps and evaluating the
                associated risks. Subsequently, control measures are proposed
                and implemented. It is mandatory for HIRA activities to be
                conducted every three years, with their effectiveness evaluated
                through annual internal audits and ISO 45001 surveillance
                audits. All audit findings are internally tracked, corrective
                actions are identified with predefined timelines and their
                implementation is monitored closely. The findings are then
                horizontally closed and implemented within the Company's
                Management Information Systems (MIS) framework.
